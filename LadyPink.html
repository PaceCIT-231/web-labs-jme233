        <p>Lady Pink was born in Ecuador, raised in NYC and currently resides in the <br> 
        north of the city. In 1979 she started writing graffiti and soon was well known <br>
        as the only female capable of competing with the boys in the graffiti subculture.<br> 
        Pink painted subway trains from the years 1979-1985. In 1982 she had a starring role<br>
        the motion picture "Wild Style". That role and her other significant contributions to<br> 
        graffiti have made her a cult figure in the hip-hop subculture.</br>
